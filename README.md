This is a fork of https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install that adds UDP support to the install.

I currently also maintain and contribute to a fork of openvpn-install-advanced @ https://github.com/zabullet/openvpn-install-advanced and therefore my preference is for people to use and contribute to that.
